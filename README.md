# MakeChangeProject

# Description
One week into my programming course at Skill Distillery, this was my first official homework project.
This project simulates a cash register program that makes the correct amount of change and outputs how many bills/coins you get back. 
Example : change of 37.77 would output 1 twenty, 1 ten, 1 five, 2 ones, 3 quarters, 2 pennies.

# Technologies Used

Java, Eclipse

I learned how to create a cash register program and effectively use the modulus operator to do so. I've learned it is very hard and tedious to work with numbers in java at times. The most frutrating part was getting the numbers to round efficiently so that the program would run to perfection. I can now say I understand more of how rounding works (although it is rather frustrating), how casting variables work as well as the use of the modulus operator. Modulus is more useful than I once thought.
